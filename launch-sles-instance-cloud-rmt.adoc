= Deploy a {sles} instance to supprt RMT (Repository Mirroring Tool) on {cloud}

== About the guide

This document will walk you through the deployment of a simple {sles} instance operating on {cloud}.

This instance can be used to support a deployment of RMT, which can be used to mirror updates from the SUSE Customer Center.

An example of the architecture for the deployment can be seen below:

This guide is split into the following sections.

* Using a BYOS image
* Considerations when using RMT

== Using a BYOS image
SUSE provides images for {sles} in {cloud}. They typically come in two flavours, PAYG (Pay As You Go), and BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription).  These images are updated at regular intervals, so it is suggested to deploy new instances from the latest version of the image to ensure the most recent security updates are in place.
In order to support the use of RMT, it is recommended to deploy a {sles} instance from a BYOS image.  

== Where to find the images in the {cloud} Marketplace

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
When using {cloud}, {sles} BYOS AMIs can be found in the AWS Marketplace.

== Considerations when using RMT

=== Disk Space
The RMT server needs enough available disk space to mirror the SUSE Liberty Linux LTSS 7 repositories. Downloaded packages are stored in /var/lib/rmt/public/repo/. The amount of storage required depends on the number of repositories you mirror. We recommend at least 1.5 times the total size of all enabled repositories.
Best practice would be to provision an additional disk volume to support this requirment.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
// ...
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
In {cloud} this would be an Amazon EBS volume. Mount the volume to '/var/lib/rmt/public/repo/' at instance creation, or immediately after launch.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
// ...
endif::[]

=== IP / Name Resolution
A static IP address or DNS name is required in order for clients to connect to RMT.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
// ...
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
In {cloud}, a CSP provided DNS is assigned when the instance is launched, but this IP/DNS address may change if the instance is recreated for any reason.  Consider using Route 53 to provide a consistent connection point for your clients.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
// ...
endif::[]


=== Connectivity (RMT)
The RMT server will need connectivity to the SCC (SUSE Customer Center) over port 80 & 443. There are many ways to provide connectivity.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
// ...
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
For example in {cloud}, depending on whether the RMT instance is in a Public or Private Subnet, connectivty to the SCC can be provided via an AWS Internet Gateway, an AWS NAT Gateway, or via a local datacenter (VPN/DX Connenction).
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
// ...
endif::[]

=== Connectivity (Clients)
Clients connecting to RMT will need to do so over port 80 & Port 443.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
// ...
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
When launching the {sles} instance to support RMT, it possible to use an existing AWS security group or create a new one.  Ensure that the security group is configured to allow inbound access to the RMT server from your clients (HTTP / HTTPS).
